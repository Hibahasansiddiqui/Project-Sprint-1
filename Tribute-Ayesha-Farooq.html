        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p> Flight Lieutenant Ayesha Farooq was the <b>first female to become a fighter pilot in Pakistan Air Force</b> and in
            fact, in all of South Asia in 2013. She now flies missions in a Chinese-made Chengdu J-7 fighter jet
            alongside her 24 male colleagues in Squadron 20.</p>

            <h2>Her Background & Struggle</h2>
            <p>Her father, a doctor, died when she was only three years old and since then, her mother supported her
            daughters (Ayesha and a younger sister) to enable and empower them to achieve their desires.
            Ayesha was the kind of girl who would go out to play cricket and football. Outdoor sports were her forte and
            where she was happiest. This rugged and adventurous spirit persisted over the years and led her to find
            inspiration in her cousin and her uncles, who are also Air Force officers.
            After making this decision, Ayesha received an expected part-skeptical and part-concerned response from her
            relatives. Uncles tried to dissuade her, worried that the demanding career would eventually drain her out,
            more so because of her gender.</p>

            <p>Military forces worldwide are usually considered to be male-dominated and in a country like Pakistan, social and family pressures dissuade women from working side by side together with men in the military forces. For this reason, the journey towards becoming a fighter pilot was not easy for Farooq. Remembering the initial difficulties she faced, Farooq says, <i><b>“the first step is difficult for everyone. I had to listen to different opinions at home. Because I was a woman I had to work harder, I had to make my male counterparts realize that I am equally aware and that I work hard just like any other good male pilot.”</b></i> Farooq, who recently got married to one of her engineer cousins, says, <i><b>“When you are working among so many men, everyone focuses on the work you are doing.”</b></i> 
            Many women do complain of the discriminatory attitudes they face at the work place, but Farooq says that in Pakistan’s Air Force, she never felt any discrimination. <i><b>“I have seen that all decisions are made on the basis of merit. No one in PAF treated me badly just because I was a woman,”</b></i> she says.</p>

            <h2>Her Academic Performance</h2>
            <p>In 2013, she became the first Pakistani female fighter pilot after topping the final exams to qualify. The
            physical training one undergoes at the flight school involves waking up at 4.30 am every morning for a
            mile-long run before starting the day. Moreover, they have to carry an MG3, a machine gun, which weighs
            about four kilograms for two hours.
            However, nothing could kill her spirit and all this only served as encouragement and made her more
            determined than ever. Her mother never wavered in her support.
            She now flies missions in a Chinese-made Chengdu J-7 fighter jet alongside her 24 male colleagues in
            Squadron 20. Of the 6 current female fighter pilots in the PAF, Flight Lieutenant Farooq is the only one
            qualified for combat and to fly sorties along the border.
            Farooq is one of 19 women to have become pilots in the PAF since the 2000s.</p>
        
            <h3>Tough training</h3>
            <p>Farooq says that many people believed that she would not be able to face the tough training of PAF, but that only encouraged her to prove herself. Getting up early in the morning, physical exercises and tough studies are all part of the training.</p>
            
            <h3>Most memorable flying moments</h3>
            <p>The journey to becoming a fighter pilot and her ongoing job has made Farooq experience some great moments, but she cherishes her first flight the most. <i><b>“It was a strange feeling, I was flying the plane alone and it was under my control. To celebrate this moment, I manoeuvred the plane up and down,”</b></i> Farooq says.</p>
            
            <h2>Role Model for Other Women</h2>            
            <p>Without a doubt, Farooq has become a role model for many Pakistani women. According to Farooq, <i><b>“Many young girls call me everyday to ask how they can also become part of the air force. Women are capable of working in profession and our society has started accepting this fact”.</b></i>
            She have open doors for women around Pakistan to look ahead and chase their dreams. Yes, the journey ahead will be difficult, however, with hope and a little bit of perseverance, you as a female can achieve the world.....Or sky in Ayesha Farooq's case.</p>
